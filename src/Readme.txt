Orbix V1.0.0
------------

Copyright 2024 - fleischgemuese

Welcome to the Orbix solar system! Your mission is simple: eliminate all the orange Orbz by launching a ball from the 
top to clear each level. But it's not just about accuracy-plan your shots carefully, use puzzle-solving skills, or 
rely on a bit of luck to conquer the game.

Watch out for special elements like:

* Tray: Save balls by targeting the tray.
* Cannons: Catch the balls and fire them in your wanted direction.
* Portals: Teleport your ball to different parts of the screen.
* Lasers: Dangerous, do not touch them or deactivate them.
* Switches: Unlock hidden areas or activate special mechanics.
* Bombs: Cause explosive chain reactions to clear obstacles.
* Gravity swaps: Change the direction of gravity to add a twist to your shots.
* Extra balls: Need some more power, unlock other balls.
* Bumbers: Boost your ball.

Plan ahead, aim wisely, and overcome every challenge to rack up as many points as you can! But be careful-the number of balls is limited. Run out, and its game over.
